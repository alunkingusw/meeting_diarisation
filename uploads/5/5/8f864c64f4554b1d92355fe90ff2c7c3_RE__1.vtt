00:00:03.386 --> 00:00:03.746
<v Nishan F U (FCES)>Yes, Sir.</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/133-0
00:00:03.906 --> 00:00:08.992
<v Alun King>Yeah, cool. OK, bro. Right.
So on on each of these sections,</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/133-1
00:00:08.992 --> 00:00:13.995
<v Alun King>you've started off by saying financial
applications, right.</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/133-2
00:00:13.995 --> 00:00:20.498
<v Alun King>So you're sort of saying user engagement
in financial applications and you're</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/133-3
00:00:20.498 --> 00:00:21.666
<v Alun King>talking about.</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/189-0
00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:26.760
<v Alun King>How users engage with it then you've got
visual processing and financial</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/189-1
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.233
<v Alun King>applications.
Then you've got back end technology for</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/156-0
00:00:29.226 --> 00:00:31.026
<v Nishan F U (FCES)>I can, yeah.</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/189-2
00:00:30.233 --> 00:00:33.256
<v Alun King>financial applications, then database out.
OK,</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/189-3
00:00:33.256 --> 00:00:37.372
<v Alun King>so you're obviously going through each
element, which is great,</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/173-0
00:00:36.386 --> 00:00:36.706
<v Nishan F U (FCES)>Yeah.</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/189-4
00:00:37.372 --> 00:00:41.746
<v Alun King>but you need to then talk about your
application. So you've talked.</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/220-0
00:00:41.866 --> 00:00:48.137
<v Alun King>Point is, in a general way to say, OK,
this is what we think about with all</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/220-1
00:00:48.137 --> 00:00:53.252
<v Alun King>financial applications,
but it's not personalising it to your</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/220-2
00:00:53.252 --> 00:00:57.626
<v Alun King>application. OK,
so either throughout or at the end.</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/266-0
00:00:58.346 --> 00:01:03.820
<v Alun King>You need to say for my application this
is what I'm going to do, OK,</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/266-1
00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:09.612
<v Alun King>because because everything you've written
here is it's not personalised.</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/235-0
00:01:06.626 --> 00:01:06.946
<v Nishan F U (FCES)>Listen.</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/266-2
00:01:09.612 --> 00:01:15.483
<v Alun King>UK is saying like security constituents
in financial applications require</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/266-3
00:01:15.483 --> 00:01:17.546
<v Alun King>comprehensive integration.</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/287-0
00:01:17.906 --> 00:01:21.592
<v Alun King>OK, So what about your your application?
OK, it doesn't.</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/287-1
00:01:21.592 --> 00:01:24.826
<v Alun King>You're not talking about your application
anyway.</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/287-2
00:01:24.826 --> 00:01:27.866
<v Alun King>You're just talking about security in
general.</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/328-0
00:01:29.426 --> 00:01:32.377
<v Alun King>OK.
So that like some sort of conclusion at</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/328-1
00:01:32.377 --> 00:01:37.609
<v Alun King>the end where once you've talked about
all of these things and you talk about</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/328-2
00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:41.835
<v Alun King>the market analysis again,
so you you've talked about existing</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/328-3
00:01:41.835 --> 00:01:45.054
<v Alun King>software,
but then you can talk about what your</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/328-4
00:01:45.054 --> 00:01:46.866
<v Alun King>application is going to do.</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/331-0
00:01:47.386 --> 00:01:47.946
<v Alun King>OK. Because.</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/353-0
00:01:47.546 --> 00:01:52.776
<v Nishan F U (FCES)>OK, Sir. Sir, as far as I understand,
in every section the last part or the</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/353-1
00:01:52.776 --> 00:01:56.011
<v Nishan F U (FCES)>middle part,
I need to explain my application,</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/339-0
00:01:53.026 --> 00:01:53.626
<v Alun King>Mm-hmm.</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/353-2
00:01:56.011 --> 00:01:56.906
<v Nishan F U (FCES)>isn't it Sir?</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/399-0
00:01:57.266 --> 00:02:02.162
<v Alun King>Yeah, like so you talked about. Yeah,
your literature review is you've read</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/399-1
00:02:02.162 --> 00:02:05.512
<v Alun King>this information,
then you need to show that you've</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/399-2
00:02:05.512 --> 00:02:08.926
<v Alun King>processed and understood it.
So you need to say, OK,</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/399-3
00:02:08.926 --> 00:02:13.178
<v Alun King>so after reading this,
I am going to do this with my application.</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/399-4
00:02:13.178 --> 00:02:16.786
<v Alun King>So show that you've kind of taken it on
board and your.</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/405-0
00:02:17.146 --> 00:02:19.546
<v Alun King>Feeding it into your prod product.</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/406-0
00:02:20.226 --> 00:02:21.226
<v Nishan F U (FCES)>Yes, Sir. Yeah.</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/449-0
00:02:22.066 --> 00:02:25.211
<v Alun King>OK.
So you talked about like all these things</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/449-1
00:02:25.211 --> 00:02:28.220
<v Alun King>and and everything you've got here is
fine,</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/417-0
00:02:26.026 --> 00:02:26.266
<v Nishan F U (FCES)>Yeah.</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/421-0
00:02:28.146 --> 00:02:28.346
<v Nishan F U (FCES)>Yeah.</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/449-2
00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.486
<v Alun King>but you could either do it throughout
like section by section or just at the</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/433-0
00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:33.146
<v Nishan F U (FCES)>Yeah.</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/449-3
00:02:33.486 --> 00:02:39.026
<v Alun King>end you could just put conclusion and you
could put like you've got here, right?</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/456-0
00:02:41.186 --> 00:02:42.226
<v Alun King>Again, it's all.</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/458-0
00:02:41.906 --> 00:02:43.506
<v Nishan F U (FCES)>Yeah. In conclusion, yeah, I.</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/459-0
00:02:45.266 --> 00:02:45.586
<v Alun King>Yeah.</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/469-0
00:02:54.386 --> 00:02:57.546
<v Alun King>But it's again,
you're not talking about your.</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/473-0
00:02:58.306 --> 00:02:59.466
<v Nishan F U (FCES)>Yes, I understand, Sir.</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/513-0
00:02:59.546 --> 00:03:04.446
<v Alun King>You're just saying generally, OK,
so so I need it to be personalised now to</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/479-0
00:03:01.706 --> 00:03:01.906
<v Nishan F U (FCES)>Yeah.</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/513-1
00:03:04.446 --> 00:03:09.025
<v Alun King>say, not just financial applications,
but like what you were creating,</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/513-2
00:03:09.025 --> 00:03:12.636
<v Alun King>what have you,
what are you going to take on board from</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/513-3
00:03:12.636 --> 00:03:14.506
<v Alun King>doing this literature review?</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/516-0
00:03:15.426 --> 00:03:16.306
<v Alun King>Does that make sense?</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/546-0
00:03:16.026 --> 00:03:20.248
<v Nishan F U (FCES)>No. Yes, Sir. I understand, Sir.
I think you, Sir,</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/546-1
00:03:20.248 --> 00:03:26.127
<v Nishan F U (FCES)>you mentioned in every section.
I need to summarise or give some of my</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/546-2
00:03:26.127 --> 00:03:29.026
<v Nishan F U (FCES)>application details. Isn't it, Sir?</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/553-0
00:03:29.706 --> 00:03:32.506
<v Alun King>Yeah, it's just personalising it.
So you've just got.</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/575-0
00:03:33.066 --> 00:03:38.475
<v Nishan F U (FCES)>What what I will do and what is I will
build about my application features on</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/575-1
00:03:38.475 --> 00:03:43.746
<v Nishan F U (FCES)>something like that I need to implement
all of the section. Isn't it still?</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/569-0
00:03:39.146 --> 00:03:39.506
<v Alun King>Yeah.</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/627-0
00:03:44.426 --> 00:03:47.392
<v Alun King>Yeah. So take like,
think about when your final project is</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/627-1
00:03:47.392 --> 00:03:50.912
<v Alun King>like everything is put together,
you're going to talk about what your</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/583-0
00:03:48.466 --> 00:03:48.706
<v Nishan F U (FCES)>Yeah.</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/587-0
00:03:50.706 --> 00:03:50.906
<v Nishan F U (FCES)>Yeah.</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/627-2
00:03:50.912 --> 00:03:53.627
<v Alun King>objectives are and what your software is
going to do.</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/627-3
00:03:53.627 --> 00:03:56.141
<v Alun King>Then you're going to have your literature
review.</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/627-4
00:03:56.141 --> 00:03:59.862
<v Alun King>So make sure you link it together so you
can you talk about your project,</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/604-0
00:03:58.186 --> 00:03:58.346
<v Nishan F U (FCES)>Oh.</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/627-5
00:03:59.862 --> 00:04:03.986
<v Alun King>then you've got your literature review,
make sure your literature review is safe.</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/612-0
00:04:00.226 --> 00:04:00.466
<v Nishan F U (FCES)>Yeah.</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/674-0
00:04:04.066 --> 00:04:09.060
<v Alun King>And so for my project this means that my
technology stack is going to be express</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/624-0
00:04:04.706 --> 00:04:04.826
<v Nishan F U (FCES)>Yeah.</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/674-1
00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.020
<v Alun King>and it's going to use Firebase as the
back end.</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/643-0
00:04:11.346 --> 00:04:11.626
<v Nishan F U (FCES)>OK so.</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/674-2
00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.856
<v Alun King>So you talked about the benefits of
Firebase,</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/674-3
00:04:14.856 --> 00:04:18.987
<v Alun King>but you haven't explicitly said that
you're going to use Firebase,</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/674-4
00:04:18.987 --> 00:04:21.146
<v Alun King>so it's just make sure that you've.</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/684-0
00:04:21.986 --> 00:04:26.146
<v Alun King>You've mentioned that and you've tied
everything you've got into your project.</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/681-0
00:04:24.306 --> 00:04:24.626
<v Nishan F U (FCES)>Person.</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/711-0
00:04:27.106 --> 00:04:30.751
<v Nishan F U (FCES)>OK, Sir.
So I think in literature review you</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/711-1
00:04:30.751 --> 00:04:36.666
<v Nishan F U (FCES)>mentioned to the programme the the
British spelling and the one thing is</v>

00:11:15.906 --> 00:11:20.557
<v Nishan F U (FCES)>And the and the main thing is that's the
presentation on the Biba.</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/1544-1

00:11:31.104 --> 00:11:34.959
<v Alun King>about that after.
So when you get to your submission,</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/1580-2
00:11:34.959 --> 00:11:40.386
<v Alun King>we can have a meeting and I can go over
what to expect from the Viber, but.</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/1564-0
00:11:35.506 --> 00:11:35.746
<v Nishan F U (FCES)>Yeah.</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/1611-0
00:11:41.026 --> 00:11:45.210
<v Alun King>Generally,
the questions you're asked to like Ian,</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/1611-1
00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:51.610
<v Alun King>send something out with all the details.
So like Ian who manages the project,</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/1611-2
00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:57.026
<v Alun King>he'll send out an e-mail of what to
expect from the presentation.</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/1663-0
00:11:57.306 --> 00:12:00.202
<v Alun King>But it's basically you just demonstrate
your project.</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/1663-1
00:12:00.202 --> 00:12:04.654
<v Alun King>You could talk about it and you're going
to answer a couple of questions about it.</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/1663-2
00:12:04.654 --> 00:12:08.355
<v Alun King>So if you've because you've spent so much
time over over the summer,</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/1663-3
00:12:08.355 --> 00:12:12.002
<v Alun King>they're not going to be hard questions.
It's going to be, you know,</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/1663-4
00:12:12.002 --> 00:12:14.362
<v Alun King>can you show me this?

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/1663-5
00:12:14.362 --> 00:12:16.186
<v Alun King>Can you show me this bit of codes?</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/1684-0
00:12:17.026 --> 00:12:20.611
<v Alun King>Questions like that,
so nothing too challenging and we can</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/1684-1
00:12:20.611 --> 00:12:25.715
<v Alun King>talk about that when you when we get into
the stage where you will be demonstrating</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/1684-2
00:12:25.715 --> 00:12:28.146
<v Alun King>and you'll be fine, you'll be all right.</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/1712-0
00:12:29.866 --> 00:12:34.950
<v Nishan F U (FCES)>Basically I think about that the Bible
will take about our presentation,</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/1712-1
00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:40.244
<v Nishan F U (FCES)>flight or the dissertation paper.
Which part they will mainly focus is a is</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/1712-2
00:12:40.244 --> 00:12:43.866
<v Nishan F U (FCES)>a dissertation paper or the the
presentation slide.</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/1714-0
00:12:44.266 --> 00:12:44.386
<v Nishan F U (FCES)>Yeah.</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/1721-0
00:12:45.586 --> 00:12:47.706
<v Alun King>Mainly on the yeah.</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/1736-0
00:12:45.666 --> 00:12:50.787
<v Nishan F U (FCES)>Or am I need to Sir?
Or am I need to Sir run the project and</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/1736-1
00:12:50.787 --> 00:12:54.146
<v Nishan F U (FCES)>bring something in front of there isn't.</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/1767-0
00:12:55.066 --> 00:12:58.018
<v Alun King>Yeah,
you can demonstrate so you can run the</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/1767-1
00:12:58.018 --> 00:13:01.299
<v Alun King>project,
but the I suppose the main questions are</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/1767-2
00:13:01.299 --> 00:13:06.812
<v Alun King>going to be not to do with the PowerPoint,
but maybe there'll be bits in the report</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/1767-3
00:13:06.812 --> 00:13:10.946
<v Alun King>and maybe there'll be bits in the code to
ask questions about.</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/1778-0
00:13:13.546 --> 00:13:16.300
<v Nishan F U (FCES)>OK,

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/1778-1
00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:17.866
<v Nishan F U (FCES)>on the project then, Sir.</v>

00:13:17.346 --> 00:13:17.786
<v Alun King>Yeah.</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/1790-0
00:13:19.106 --> 00:13:20.851
<v Nishan F U (FCES)>OK,
not the presentation on sliders or</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/1790-1
00:13:20.851 --> 00:13:21.746
<v Nishan F U (FCES)>something like that.</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/1824-0
00:13:21.586 --> 00:13:25.632
<v Alun King>No, I mean you, you do the presentation,

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/1824-1
00:13:25.632 --> 00:13:28.530
<v Alun King>questions about that because I'll have
only just seen it.</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/1824-2
00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:30.878
<v Alun King>So it's actually the project is the big
thing.</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/1824-3
00:13:30.878 --> 00:13:33.426
<v Alun King>So that'll be the bit that we ask
questions about.</v>

9783cb20-dd31-48f7-824f-c16407ee25d6/1870-0
